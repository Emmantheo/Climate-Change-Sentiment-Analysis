# Climate Change Sentiment Analysis
This repository is a complete directory to the climate change sentiment analysis project.

## Overview: Climate Change Belief Analysis
Many companies are built around lessening oneâ€™s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.

With this context, I am creating Machine Learning system that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.

Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.

To enhance this project, I decided to build data and machine learning pipelines in order to avoid hardcoding and work in a development and production environment at the same time, to ensure reproducibility and modularity.
